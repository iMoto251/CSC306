The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

To build the appropriate scheduler, enter

make fcfs
make sjf
make rr
make priority
make priority_rr

which builds the executable files for each of the scheduling algorithms.

The command used to execute the file is ./[program name] [schedule].txt
Each program takes the tasks that have been input through the text file and runs them through the scheduled algorithm.

Each algorithm does what it's name implies.

FCFS takes the first task, runs it, moves to the next until all tasks have been completed.
SJF takes the list, sorts them into the shortest to longest jobs, then executes them.
RR acts the same as FCFS, but executes the tasks in 10 unit intervals.
Priority takes into account the priority of each task, executing the highest priority first, then moving down the list.
Priority RR is the same as priority, but it takes the RR algorithm and executes them in 10 unit intervals until the tasks are complete.
